## What you get on Codecademy

Within each lesson, there are two parts. On one hand, the tutorials will teach you what you need to learn for that section. This is absolutely crucial. On the other hand, the projects help you consolidate what you've just learned into a fun and exciting experience. I wouldn't say that these are "necessary", but I highly recommend that you go through at least some of the projects so that you can see the real-world applications of what you've just learned.

Feel free to skip a project and come back to it later. However, make sure that you do the tutorials in ascending order since they build on one another.
