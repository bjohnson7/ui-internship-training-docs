## Tutorials

Carefully go through each tutorial. Don't be afraid to experiment in the text editor. You should move on to the next tutorial only **AFTER **you feel comfortable with all aspects of what you just learned. If not, don't be afraid to spend some extra time on it.

Use the tutorials below:

## What you get

At w3schools.com, there are some very good tutorials that will ensure that you have a strong foundation in CSS. But you only get as much as you put in. Make sure to learn everything right the first time around!

At codecademy.com, HTML and CSS is taught together via tutorials and hands-on projects. This is probably the best way to teach these languages as CSS and HTML go hand in hand!

**Tip:** Try opening Google DevTools (for Chrome) using `CTRL + SHIFT + I` **or Firebug (for Firefox)**.** These nifty tools allow you to live-edit the CSS for any site. Go to a familiar or famous site and mess with the CSS to see what you can do with it (e.g. change Facebook's color scheme or alter Liferay's public website to your liking). This can be a fun, hands-on way to learn CSS alongside the tutorials. This will also be helpful when/if you build your own theme for Liferay or need to debug a CSS issue.
