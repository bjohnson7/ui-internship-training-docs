###### There are two editions of Liferay â€“ the Community Edition (CE) and the Enterprise Edition (EE).

## Liferay CE

Liferay CE is free for anyone to download and use, and it usually has some of the newest features as they are completed.

## Liferay EE

Liferay EE, on the other hand, requires a subscription fee. With this fee, customers are given a license key and are given access to our support team.  The customers are also able to choose from varying levels or support based on their needs.

Unlike CE, EE does not necessarily have all the newest cutting edge features, but instead, it offers a greater level of stability.  The customer will get fix packs based on their needs and new updates/releases which are certified and tested by our QA team. EE is designed to be more stable because the target audience for EE is often (large) companies who are looking for the reliability, security, and performance of an enterprise environment.
